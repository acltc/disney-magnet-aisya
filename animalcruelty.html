			<h3>-Puppymills</h3>
			<p>Puppymills are  dog breeding facilities that are used to generate money, with little regard to the dog's well being.  Often times, the puppies are born with diseases and disorders.  The female dogs that are used to reproduce are put down after they're unable to breed anymore. Also, the female dogs barely get any time to recover after giving birth.  Puppymills sometimes sell puppies to pet stores, so you can help by adopting from your local animal shelter, rather than a pet store or breeder.  
			<h3>-Dog fighting</h3>
			<p>Dog fighting is mainly for entertainment and gambling purposes. The dogs used are usually Pitbulls, and are isolated from friendly interactions with humans and other dogs. They are forced to consume steriods to make them stronger and are trained to kill on demand. After fighting, dogs that lose too much blood to function well are often killed rather than treated.
			<h3>-Animal hoarding</h3>
			<p>Animal hoarding is caused by depression and mental pain. Animal hoarding could lead to neglection of the animals, and sadness.
